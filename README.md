# CCoT
Official Codebase for the Paper "Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Multimodal Models"

We present **CCoT**, a novel **C**compositional **C**hain-**o**f-**T**hought prompting method that utilizes scene-graph representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. We find that this approach not only improves LMM performance on several compositional benchmarks but also general multimodal benchmarks as well.
